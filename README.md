# Assesment

In unit test project, Added initial data to local Db by reading JSON object, Created Mock Json for products https://www.mockaroo.com/.

Added swagger for API

- Inventory API.

Product with already sold status cannot be updated.

Product with damaged status cannot be sold.

Not sure whether I need to generate barcode image in save db and id should be mapped to product table.

And API's Product and Category is added for reference.
